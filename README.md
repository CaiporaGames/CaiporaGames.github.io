Think in a person who loves discover strange things about gaming and programming ðŸ¤ª
  
 I've study about Unity and game in general since 2018 and i've done some small games in the past but no one got great popularity.ðŸ™ˆ
  
I have a small channel on youtube where i share a bit what i am learning in my [game dev journey ðŸš€](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkiqlgDnCQk3W2rvu9fjRCQ)
  
If you have any doubt or interest in something do anxiety on reaching me out.

Cheers!
